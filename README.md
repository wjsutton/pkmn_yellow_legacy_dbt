> **‚ö†Ô∏è This repository is currently being refactored to make it more user-friendly. Documentation and setup instructions are being improved.**

A **dbt** project to analyse and model data from the **Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy** ROM hack, helping trainers optimise their journey through Kanto.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project transforms raw Pok√©mon game data into analytical models that can help answer questions like:
- What's the optimal team composition for beating the game?
- Which Pok√©mon have the best stat distributions for specific roles?
- How do movesets evolve throughout the game progression?
- What are the most efficient routes for experience grinding?

The project leverages dbt's powerful transformation capabilities to create clean, tested, and documented datasets from Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy game data.

## üöÄ What is Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy?

Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy is a ROM hack created by TheSmithPlays that aims to fix and polish the original Pok√©mon Yellow while staying true to Generation 1's vision. This project analyzes data from this enhanced version of the classic game.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure (Work in Progress)

The project is being restructured, but will include models for:

- **Raw Data Layer**: Seed tables added to duckdb with `dbt seed`
- **Staging Layer**: Cleaned and standardized data
- **Intermediate Layer**: Key tables for team optimisation
  - [Available Pok√©mon](/models/intermediate/int_pokemon_availability.sql)
  - [Trainer's Pok√©mon](/models/intermediate/int_trainer_roster.sql)
  - [Order of the Game](/models/intermediate/int_game_progression.sql)
  - [All Pok√©mon Matchups](/models/intermediate/int_battle_analysis.sql)
  - [Prep work for Python Optimisation Models](/models/intermediate/int_team_optimization.sql)

## üìà Roadmap

- [ ] **Phase 1**: Refactor existing models for better usability
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Implement pokemon availablity check tests
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Create exposure layer
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Add documentation

## ü§ù Contributing

This project is currently under active development and refactoring. Contributions will be welcomed once the initial restructuring is complete!

### Ideas for Future Contributions:
- Ability to create a Mono-type run
- [Pokemon showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) integration for better battle simulation models
- Applications for next Pokemon Legacy games: Crystal and Emerald
